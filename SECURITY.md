# Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Issue

To report a security issue, please email [security@typelevel.org](mailto:security@typelevel.org) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.  The Security Team will attempt to respond within 3 working days of your email.  If the issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will open a Security Advisory.  This project follows a 90 day disclosure timeline.

## Procedure

1. A GitHub Security Advisory will be created in the appropriate repository.
2. A project member works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
3. The project creates a new release of the package the vulnerabilty affects to deliver its fix.
4. The project publicly announces the vulnerability and describes how to apply the fix.

## Scala Steward

We strongly recommend users of our libraries to use [Scala Steward](https://github.com/scala-steward-org/scala-steward) or something similar to 
automatically receive updates.
